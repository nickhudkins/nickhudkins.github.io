title: Here We Go Again
lead-in: I've launched, re-launched, and re-re-launched my website numerous times. This time, I plan on keeping it. (It even has a blog.)

Long ago, my website existed simply as a playground for me to post work that I could show off.

Now I find myself pretty consistently occupied with work and family, but was finding that I wasn't giving back as much as I was taking from the community at large. This is my effort to begin doing that.

**I learn stuff...ALL the time.** I figured I could share some of that with you.
